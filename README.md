# Project Plan

Purpose of this repo is to detail how I plan to conduct the study on Korean parliamentary elections, with several following repos to come. 
The KR-parliamentary repo cleans data from dataset that Kuniaki Nemoto has collected.
The parliamentary_PR_shiny constructs Shiny app that includes the visualization of Nemoto's data, based on ideology.
